# Carbon-Forming

A platform to support the evolution of distributed DIY carbon removal technology though monthly competition and collaboration.

## Build and Run

In order to have a speedy development process, we use [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions). The actions automate the building and pushing of the project source files. All you need to do is setup your development environment, and push to the repo. The actions will do the rest.

## Setup the development environment

Please follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/openair-collective/Carbon-Forming/wiki/Build-and-Run-this-webpage-locally) to setup your development environment.

> Please always test your changes in a local environment before pushing to the repo. This is to prevent you from accidentally pushing broken changes to the public, and to speed up development.
